Outliers are unusual or rare observations that deviate from the typical pattern or distribution of data. Identifying and handling outliers is an important step in data preprocessing and model building because they can have a disproportionate impact on the performance of machine learning models"],"metadata":{"id":"Zggc3j936n6E"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# When are dangerous\n","Outliers in machine learning can be problematic when they disrupt the assumptions of statistical models, particularly in small datasets or with sensitive algorithms, potentially leading to biased results, misclassification, or poor generalization.\n","# When are not dangerous\n","However, in larger datasets and with robust algorithms, outliers may have a limited impact on model performance.

Hypothesis Testing**\n","\n","Hypothesis testing is a statistical method to make decisions or inferences about a population based on sample data. It’s used to determine if there’s enough evidence in a sample to conclude that a certain claim about the population is likely true.\n","\n","#### **1.a Introduction**\n","\n","Hypothesis testing helps us decide whether to accept or reject an assumption about a population parameter. This process involves:\n","- **Formulating a hypothesis**: Making a claim about a population parameter.\n","- **Collecting sample data**: Gathering data to evaluate the hypothesis.\n","- **Calculating test statistics**: Quantifying how far our sample data deviates from the claim.\n","- **Making a decision**: Based on calculated values, we determine whether the data supports or contradicts our initial claim.\n","\n","#### **1.b Hypothesis Formulation**\n","\n","There are two key hypotheses:\n","1. **Null Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\))**: This is the default claim, stating that there is no effect or difference. It’s what we assume to be true unless evidence strongly suggests otherwise.\n","2. **Alternative Hypothesis (\\(H_a\\))**: This is the opposing claim, suggesting that there is an effect or difference.\n","\n","For example:\n","- \\(H_0\\): The average weight of a product is 500 grams.\n","- \\(H_a\\): The average weight of a product is not 500 grams\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"BM-7qFfPiz7X"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RepLQA8kjljJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **2.

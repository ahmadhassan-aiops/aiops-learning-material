Confidence Interval**\n","\n","A **confidence interval (CI)** is a range of values that likely contains the true population parameter (such as the mean) based on sample data. Instead of giving a single number as an estimate, a confidence interval provides a range, which helps in understanding the potential error or uncertainty in the estimate.\n","\n","#### **1.1 Why Use a Confidence Interval?**\n","When we take a sample from a population, it’s nearly impossible to know the exact population parameter (like the true mean or proportion) just from the sample. However, by constructing a confidence interval, we can estimate a range within which the true value probably lies. For instance, if we have a 95% confidence interval for a sample mean, we can say that we are 95% confident that the population mean lies within this interval.\n","\n","#### **1.2 Components of a Confidence Interval**\n","\n","- **Sample Mean $(\\bar{x}$)**: This is the average of the sample data.\n","- **Standard Deviation (s)**: Measures the spread of data points in the sample.\n","- **Sample Size (n)**: The number of observations in the sample.\n","- **Confidence Level**: This represents how confident we are that the interval contains the population parameter. Common levels are 90%, 95%, and 99%.\n","\n","The **confidence level** is directly related to a value called the **Z-score** (in the case of large samples) or **t-score** (for smaller samples or when population variance is unknown). For example, a 95% confidence level corresponds to a Z-score of approximately 1.96 for a normal distribution.\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"1dzTXcmUczLC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### **1.3 Calculating a Confidence Interval for the Mean**\n","\n","##### **Formula**\n","\n","For a sample mean, the confidence interval is calculated as:\n","\n","\n","$$\\text{Confidence Interval} = \\bar{x} \\pm Z \\cdot \\left(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)$$\n","\n","Where:\n","- $\\bar{x} = Sample Mean$\n","- $Z$ = Z-score associated with the desired confidence level\n","- $s$ = Sample Standard Deviation\n","- $n$ = Sample Size\n","\n","##### **Example**: 95% Confidence Interval for a Sample Mean\n","\n","Suppose you collected a sample of weights of 100 people, with a mean weight of 70 kg and a standard deviation of 10 kg.

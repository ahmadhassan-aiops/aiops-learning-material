In this lab we will see how to manage dockercontianers through elastic container service.


Step # 1 Go to Elastic Container Service or ECS and create a cluster.
Creating a cluster in ECS (docker-mastery)


Step # 2
Go inside the cluster and select task definition and define your task.
mastery:nginx-testing  (my-name)

here you need to define the task, give image URI from ECR and mention the PORT that you exposed in your image
host_port should be same as container port. (8080 in my case)

106412461727.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docker-mastery:ngnix-testing



Step # 3 
Go to the cluster again and create a task from tasks tab, mention the task definition you want to use and deploy it.

	(i used 80 and 80)

Step # 4
Make sure the security group attached to the task allows public access, modify inbound rules to security group depending upto your container ports.
i.e in my case i have to create custom tcp where I provided port 80 access to myip/all traffic!

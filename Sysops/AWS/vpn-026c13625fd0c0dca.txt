! Amazon Web Services
! Virtual Private Cloud

! AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of
! a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned an identifier and is
! associated with two other identifiers, namely the
! Customer Gateway Identifier and Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
!
! Your VPN Connection ID      : vpn-026c13625fd0c0dca
! Your Virtual Private Gateway ID  : vgw-0a8bc9fb676f48aca
! Your Customer Gateway ID      : cgw-0d1232880b7d4bb74
!
!
! This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be
! configured on your Customer Gateway.3.148.130.39

! IPSec Tunnel #1
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
!
! A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption,
! authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key parameters.
! Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
!
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
!
! The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
! Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).
! To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall rules to unblock UDP port 4500.
! If not behind NAT, and you are not using an Accelerated VPN, we recommend disabling NAT-T. If you are using an Accelerated VPN, make sure that NAT-T is enabled.
!
! Configuration begins in root VDOM.

! #2: IPSec Configuration
!
! The IPSec transform set defines the encryption, authentication, and IPSec
! mode parameters.
!
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".

Go to VPN-->IPSec--> AutoKey, create Phase 2

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #3: Tunnel Interface Configuration
!  
! A tunnel interface is configured to be the logical interface associated  
! with the tunnel. All traffic routed to the tunnel interface will be 
! encrypted and transmitted to the VPC. Similarly, traffic from the VPC
! will be logically received on this interface.
!
!
! The address of the interface is configured with the setup for your 
! Customer Gateway.  If the address changes, the Customer Gateway and VPN 
! Connection must be recreated with Amazon VPC.
!
! This is required in order for tunnel failover via gwtect to function
! Perform this from the Global VDOM.

Go to System Tab --> Network --> Interface --> wan1 and edit vpn-026c13625fd0c0dca-0

 a. Name: Tunnel. Tunnel1
 b. IP : 169.254.14.70
 c. Remote IP: 169.254.14.69
 d. Select Ping
 e. Administrative Status: Up
 f. Select Ok.

You can set MTU and MSS on the tunnel by:
 config system interface
  edit "vpn-026c13625fd0c0dca-0"
    set mtu 1427
    set tcp-mss 1379
   next



! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #4 Static Route Configuration
!
! Your Customer Gateway needs to set a static route for the prefix corresponding to your
! VPC to send traffic over the tunnel interface.
! An example for a VPC with the prefix 10.0.0.0/16 is provided below:

Go to Router Tab --> Static --> Static Route, and click on Create New

 a. Destination IP/Mask: 10.0.0.0/16
 b. Device: vpn-026c13625fd0c0dca-0
 c. Gateway: 169.254.14.69
 d. Select Ok

! Static routing does not allow for failover of traffic between tunnels. If there is a problem with one of the
! tunnels, we would want to failover the traffic to the second tunnel. This is done by using "gwdetect" in fortigate.
! The gwdetect command will ping the other end of the tunnel, and check if the tunnel is up. If the pings fail, it will
! remove the static route from the routing table, and the second route in the table will become active.
!
! This can be done only using the CLI.
!
! The following config will tell the Fortigate device, what IP it should ping to test the tunnel. This IP should be
! the inside IP address of the virtual private gateway.
! This is required in order for tunnel failover via gwtect to function. Additionally, this is required to keep the tunnel up, since
! traffic must be sent from your side of the VPN tunnel to prevent the tunnel from being taken down.

config system interface
    edit "vpn-026c13625fd0c0dca-0"
        set vdom "root"
        set gwdetect enable
        set detectserver "169.254.14.69"
    next
end

!
! You can set the interval and failtime for gwdetect. Interval is number of seconds between pings. Failtime is the number
! of lost consecutive pings.Using the respective values of 2 and 5, your tunnel will failover in 10 seconds.

Go to System --> Network --> Options

Under Dead Gateway Detection:
 a. Detection Interval: 2
 b. Fail-over Detection: 5

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #5: Firewall Policy Configuration
!
! Create a firewall policy permitting traffic from your local subnet to the VPC subnet and vice versa
! This example policy permits all traffic from the local subnet to the VPC.

Go to Firewall --> Policy --> Policy
1) Create New
   a. Source Interface/Zone = internal ! This is the interface out which your local LAN resides
   b. Source Address = all
   c. Destination Interface/Zone = "vpn-026c13625fd0c0dca-0"
   d. Destination Address = all
   e. Schedule = always
   f. Service = ANY
   g. Action = ACCEPT
   h. Click OK

! Now create a policy to permit traffic going the other way

2) Create New
   a. Source Interface/Zone = "vpn-026c13625fd0c0dca-0" ! This is the interface out which your local LAN resides
   b. Source Address = all
   c. Destination Interface/Zone = internal
   d. Destination Address = all
   e. Schedule = always
   f. Service = ANY
   g. Action = ACCEPT

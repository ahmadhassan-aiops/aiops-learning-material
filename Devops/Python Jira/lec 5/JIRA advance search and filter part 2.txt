 JQL : project = PP AND issuetype = Story AND status = "To Do" AND assignee in (EMPTY, currentUser()) 
JQL : project = PP AND issuetype = Story AND status in ("In Progress", "To Do") AND assignee in (EMPTY, currentUser()) 
JQL : project = PP AND issuetype = Story AND status in ("In Progress", "To Do") AND assignee in (EMPTY)

Lecture 6 :- 

JQL : project = PP AND issuetype = Story AND status = Done 
OR  JQL : project = PP AND issuetype = Story AND status in (Done) 

 We can create own JQL :- 
Query : I want python project with issue type is epic only and status must be in progress  JQL : project = "Python Project" AND issuetype = epic AND status = "In Progress" Switch back to JQL --> auto filter will applied  JQL : project = "Python Project" AND issuetype = story  AND status = "In Progress" and status = "To Do" We have three status : TO DO , In progress and DONE  JQL : project = "Python Project" AND issuetype = story  AND status in ("In Progress","To Do") OR JQL : project = "Python Project" AND issuetype = story  AND status != DOne 

 JQL : project = PP AND issuetype = Story AND status in ("In Progress", "To Do") AND text ~ "user" 

We can filter only EPIC ticket :- JQL : "Epic Link" = AC-4

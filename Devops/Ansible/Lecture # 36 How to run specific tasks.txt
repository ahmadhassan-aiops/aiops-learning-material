Running specific tasks:
you can run specific tasks by assigning tags with the task in yml file.

never: when you add never in your tag it means, when you run normally, ansible playbook without mentioning a tag nothing will be executed.
tasks will only be executed unless the task tag is mentioned.


# Example:

vim tags.yml

---
- name: This is playbook for tags
  hosts: ubuntu
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Installation wget
    apt:
      name: wget
      state: present
    tags:
      - wget_install
  - name: Installation vim
    apt:
      name: vim
      state: present
    tags:
      - vim_install
  - name: Removing wget
    apt:
      name: wget
      state: absent
    tags:
      - wget_remove
  - name: Remvoing vim
    apt:
      name: vim
      state: absent
    tags:
      - vim_remove


# only task which install wget is executed
ansible-playbook tags.yml --tags wget_install

How to run multiple task with a single tag and not to run any task when ansible playbook is run wthout mentioning a tag?



# you can imp tag in first two tasks, you can run these task by mentioning imp
# example
ansible-playbook tags.yml --tags imp

# never means do not run task in normal mode, those task with never tag will not run by following command
ansible-playbook tags.yml

# how to run all task except the wget_install task, following command will skip wget_install task (will also not run task including never tag)
ansible-playbook tags.yml --skip-tags wget_install

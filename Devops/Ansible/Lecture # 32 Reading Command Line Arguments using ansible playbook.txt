# in this lecture we will learn how to pass arguments in command line in ansible playbook

sudo vim command_arg.yml

---
- name: this yml file is for command line arguments
  hosts: ubuntu
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: installing the zip package
    apt:
      name: "{{ package_name }}"
      state: "{{ package_state }}"



# command to run above file, you can use -e or --extra-vars any of both
ansible-playbook command_arg.yml --extra-vars "package_name=zip package_state=present"



If you have defined varibale in playbook and you also pass its value in command line, then command line value will overwrite the value defined in ansible playbook

==================================

If you have multiple inventory files (hosts), such as hosts, inv, inv2.
You can mention which inventory file to use while running the command
# for example
ansible-playbook -i inv print.yml

# now it will use inv file to look for the host mentioned in print.yml file

===================================


Using variables in messages:

    - name: Print variables and message
      debug:
        msg:
          - "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
          - "{{ ansible_hostname }}"
          - "Infinix"

Architecture of Ansible:

Ansible server of ansible engine communicates with machines (servers) through ssh service.

Communication type:
1) Ad-hoc command --> simple command line, e.g free -g
2) playbook --> yml file --> command and tell everything what configuration to do which machine to target




# EXAMPLE Of architecture

We have ansible installed. So, we have ansible server or engine.

Now, suppose I hvae 4 machines each one has different OS:
server/node/machine-1 ip: 192.168.43.1
server/node/machine-2 ip: 192.168.43.2
server/node/machine-3 ip: 192.168.43.3
server/node/machine-4 ip: 192.168.43.4


the information about all these machines will be in inventory file of ansibel which is in /etc directory

Ad-hoc command, in it you will mention which machine to take from inventoey file either machine-1,2,3,4 which machine to take and what to run


ansible.cfg --> very important file. It manages the remote server or machines

We have inventory file which is called hosts by default and its path is defined in ansible.cfg file.
Suppose we have multiple invetory files with different names containing different machines.
we can define the worker nodes differently in these inventory files as we like


Suppose I want to connect to worker node ubuntu from centos9(master node):

1) I can create an ssh key of centos9 and copy it in ubuntu and can do password free communication
2) i can define username and password of centos9 in the inventory file, whenever it will do communication with centos9 it will use the password and 
username of inventory file


# example
[ubuntu]
54.166.4.83 ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_pass=********

Now, you don't need to copy an ssh key of centos into ubuntu


What if their are 10 worker nodes, will you define user and password for each?
In such case you can define variables.

Suppose all 10 worker nodes are in same network and have same username and password
[vars:all]
ansible_ssh_user=ahsan
ansible_ssh_pass=*******


[centos1]
192.168.43.63
192.168.43.64
192.168.43.65 and so on


now, for interacting with all these machines ahsan and ******* will be used.

Case 1 if all machines have same username and password:
[worker_nodes]
192.168.43.64
192.168.43.65
192.168.43.66
192.168.43.67
192.168.43.68
192.168.43.69
192.168.43.70
192.168.43.71
192.168.43.72
192.168.43.73
192.168.43.74
192.168.43.75

[worker_nodes:vars]
ansible_ssh_user=a
ansible_ssh_pass=ABC


Case 2 if all machines have different username and password, then we define individually for all worker nodes
[worker_nodes]
192.168.43.64 ansible_ssh_user=user1 ansible_ssh_pass=password1
192.168.43.65 ansible_ssh_user=user2 ansible_ssh_pass=password2
192.168.43.66 ansible_ssh_user=user3 ansible_ssh_pass=password3
192.168.43.67 ansible_ssh_user=user4 ansible_ssh_pass=password4
192.168.43.68 ansible_ssh_user=user5 ansible_ssh_pass=password5
192.168.43.69 ansible_ssh_user=user6 ansible_ssh_pass=password6
192.168.43.70 ansible_ssh_user=user7 ansible_ssh_pass=password7
192.168.43.71 ansible_ssh_user=user8 ansible_ssh_pass=password8
192.168.43.72 ansible_ssh_user=user9 ansible_ssh_pass=password9
192.168.43.73 ansible_ssh_user=user10 ansible_ssh_pass=password10
192.168.43.74 ansible_ssh_user=user11 ansible_ssh_pass=password11
192.168.43.75 ansible_ssh_user=user12 ansible_ssh_pass=password12

Lecture 4 : Docker Notes



Note: jab bhi aapko docker image ko remove karna he to rmi command use hoga and container ko remove karna he to rm commands use hoga
docker rm  conatiner-id
docker rmi  image-id/name

Query Time:-
#docker run --name mycontainer busybox
Question : what is use of above command.
Ans: This command will create container and execute with user define name like my container


#docker run --rm --name mycon1 busybox
Question : what is use of above command.
ANS: Once the command will executed then busybox container will remove from docker ps -a command or stopped container list


docker run -it --name  container-name  busybox  /bin/sh
-it stand for : Interactive Terminal

Now when we write docker -ps it will show the running docker container
in sh we can run following command

1. uname -a 
2. echo $SHELL
4. touch samplefile
3. exit (to move out)

When we move out to check the file it will not be present as it was created in docker file and not in our OS.

To start the already present container without going into the shell we can run the following command
#docker start conatinername
#docker exec -it containername /bin/sh
Now even if we exit the container will keeps on running

List Concept :-
1. Docker image --> Are read only ? Yes we can not edit image
2. Image se container banta hain --> Process + we can go inside the container and edit the file if you want
Reason :- When we create container it will be add one editable layer over the image

Docker images are readable and executable



----------------------------------------------------------------------




Docker run --> Create container from images
If image not exist in local then it will get from docker HUB
-it--> T ogo to inside the container

Docker exec --> It take the shell of container to go inside the terminal

Docker run --> Container create + inside the container + if you exit inside the container then container will die
Docker exec --> Running ke ander lekar jata hain, (take you inside the container)

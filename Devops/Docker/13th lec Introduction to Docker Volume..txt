Lecture 13 : Docker Notes



I am loosing data from containers--> Persistent
#Container remove, Kill or stop or anything --> never loss your data
#container as process
#Docker volume
Three way data types stored
2 way is very imp
1 way not imp


Docker storage types :-
1. Volumes (Important) --> /var/lib/docker
2. Bind Mount (Important)
3. tmpfs(not important)


1. Volume : it is also called docker volume, data will stored via docker area into base machine.
2. Bind mount : it is also called docker bind , Container data will sored into filesystem like vfs, zfs,overlay overlay2 etc
3. tmpfs : its stored into RAM when reboot your machine then your data will wipe out.


Docker area --> Docker home
Docker home --> Docker database
Docker Area OR Docker home OR Docker databases --> path /var/lib/docker

Docker volume path : /var/lib/docker/volumes
docker image path : /var/lib/docker/image/overlay2/imagedb/metadata/sha256
# docker volume ls  (it is a direct command)



Docker storage :-
1. Docker volumes :- These are stored on the host file system that docker managers , on my ubuntu system path is /var/lib/docker/volumes

2. Bind Mounts :- These allow sotrage to be mounted from anywhere on the host system. for example /home/aadmin/data. you could even mount /data,

/home/aadmin/data --> changes happened
/data --> changes will replicated

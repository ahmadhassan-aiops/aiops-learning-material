Lecture 28 : Docker notes


Docker networking --> Concepts --> Imp --> Kubernets --> Networking complex

VIRT library :-
Virt --> base os --> ubuntu

Virt share --> DE

Docker engine is who [ Layed role moving library from host OS to container
Example: -
Virtual Library -->Host  OS --> 2 container



Docker network model --> CNM --> Container networking model
Kubernetes --> CNI --> Container networking interface

Networking product:--> Calico , sweeper,


CNM --> 5 main components --> Docker Engine --> Libnetwork --> CNM communication
#yum install docker-cli #yum install container.io
#ls

IPAM driver : IPAM driver same as DHCP , 2 role --> 1 , Making IP pool 2 --> allocated IP from pool


Network Driver :Network create/Delete or add/remove allocation

Network --> NAT , Bridge, Host

Network Sandbox --> Routing bw two or more container , ip managed


Docker networking
1. None : No ip assigned on this driver
2. Host: host to host communication : there is no concept of NAT
3. Bridge : It will be communicate container to host machine , use NAT
a. Default --> Docker0
b. User define --> you can create your own name

Host machine : 192.168.1.1
Container 172..17.0.1
Docker0 --> Gateway NAT

Every namespace has a deault serviceaccount that has the token to talk to kubernetes API server.
When you create a pod without specifying a service account to use, it uses default service account and default token and it is not good.

So, you need to create a service account and mention in it not to use autonoumous mounting of default token

# example of service account my-sa which does not uses default token and does not mount it
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: my-sa
automountServiceAccountToken: false



# example of a pod using this service account
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  serviceAccountName: my-sa
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
  containers:
  - name: my-cont
    image: nginx



# now if you check this pod you will not see a serviceaccount path where token is present
kubectl get pod my-pod -o yaml




# now create a pod with default service account wihtout mentioning a serviceaccount in its manifest file
# now check the pod
kubectl get pod default-sa-pod -o yaml


now in results look for service account you will find a path, enter this pod go to path and you can easily read default token.


So, using default serviceaccount is not a good option

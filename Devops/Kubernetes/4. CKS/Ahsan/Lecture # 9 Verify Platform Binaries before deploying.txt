erifying Platform Binaries in Kubernetes (CKS)
This is an important security topic in the Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) exam. Let me explain what it means and how to implement it.

What is Verifying Platform Binaries?
Verifying platform binaries means ensuring that all Kubernetes components (kubelet, kube-apiserver, etcd, etc.) running on your cluster are authentic, unmodified versions from the official Kubernetes distribution.

This protects against:

Malicious actors replacing binaries with compromised versions

Accidental use of incorrect or modified versions

Ensuring consistency across your cluster

# search on google to open the kubernetes documentation
verify signed artifacts kubernetes



# go to kubernetes github and then on right side come down you wil see releases tag, open it
# Now, here you will see all the kubernetes released versions.

# checking your version of client and  server
kubectl version


Example of verifying your client binary
Step # 1
find your version in kubernetes releases suppor i have 1.32.3

Step # 2 open the release and here you will see client, server binaries
if you have linux and 64 bit operating system look for linuxamd64 binary

for example:
https://dl.k8s.io/v1.32.3/kubernetes-client-linux-amd64.tar.gz

# now run following command on your system to download this binary
curl -LO https://dl.k8s.io/v1.32.3/kubernetes-client-linux-amd64.tar.gz kubernetes-client-linux-amd64.tar.gz

# now you will see a file kubernetes-client-linux-amd64.tar.gz in your directory

Step # 3
# calculating sha512 of the file
sha512sum kubernetes-client-linux-amd64.tar.gz

# now it will give you has copy it and go to the release page again in github

Step # 4
# now you need to match sha512 you calculated and present in front of your release
# simple step is press ctrl+f now search bar will open and paste your calculated hash, if it shows you a result then your client binary is verified and is downloaded from authentic source.
If no match is found then you may have download a compromised binary or may have calculate sha512 o a wrong file.

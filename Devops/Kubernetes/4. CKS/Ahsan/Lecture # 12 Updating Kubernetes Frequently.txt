What Does "Update Kubernetes Frequently" Mean in CKS?
üîπ Short Answer:
It refers to updating the Kubernetes control plane and worker nodes ‚Äî i.e., the entire Kubernetes cluster.

 It Includes:
The Kubernetes control plane components: kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, etc.

The kubelet and kube-proxy on each node.

The tools like kubeadm, kubectl.

Addressing security vulnerabilities by updating to newer releases.

‚ö†Ô∏è Outdated Kubernetes clusters often have known security flaws, deprecated APIs, and missing security features ‚Äî which is why the CKS exam focuses on keeping your cluster secure and updated.





What Does "Update Kubernetes Frequently" Mean?
This CKS objective refers to:

Keeping your Kubernetes control plane and worker nodes up to date.

Ensuring you are not using deprecated APIs, vulnerable components, or outdated features.

Patching security vulnerabilities in kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl, api-server, etc.

Staying current with the Kubernetes release cycle, which is ~every 3 months.

‚ö†Ô∏è Security vulnerabilities in outdated Kubernetes versions can allow unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or data leakage.

üìå Two Common Setups
Setup	                        Tool	     Upgrade Method
Production-grade clusters	kubeadm	     Manual upgrade per node
Local/lab/testing	        kind	     :Delete and recreate cluster with newer image



Method of updating kind and kubeadm are different.

How to Update kind cluster?
updating a kind cluster is quite easy and simple.

Step # 1 remove kind old version and install binary of new version

# Remove old version (if any)
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/kind

# Download latest version
curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.23.0/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind

# Confirm version
kind version


Step # 2 delete the existing kind cluster
Make sure to get backup or manifest yaml files for resources running in old cluster like pods, services, secrets and etc


# deleting cluster
kind delete cluster


# create new cluster with latest kind cluster image
kind create cluster --image kindest/node:v1.30.0


# example of creating multinode cluster
# cluster-config.yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
- role: worker
- role: worker


# now run the following command
kind create cluster --config cluster-config.yaml --image kindest/node:v1.30.0



REAL WORLD PRODUCTION SCENARIOS:
For kubeadm-based Clusters (Just for Your Info)
In real-world clusters, upgrades are done using kubeadm upgrade. It involves:

1) Backing up etcd

2) Upgrading kubeadm

3) Running kubeadm upgrade plan

4) Upgrading the control plane and then each node

5) Updating kubelet and kubectl

You don‚Äôt need to do this for kind, but CKS expects you to understand it conceptually.

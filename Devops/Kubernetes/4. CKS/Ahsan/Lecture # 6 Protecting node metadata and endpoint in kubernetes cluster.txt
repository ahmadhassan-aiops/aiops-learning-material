In order to achieve restriction at cluster level, first best practive is to deny all incoming and outgoing traffic of cluster
After that only allow what is required.

You need to install calico with kind cluster to enforce network policies.
You can get cluster configuration files in network-polices directory in ubuntu


# cluster configuration file
# kind-config.yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
networking:
  disableDefaultCNI: true
  podSubnet: "192.168.0.0/16"
nodes:
- role: control-plane


# command to install calico after you have set up cluster
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.26.1/manifests/calico.yaml



I used only alnafi intenral and external pods and services
# now use policy4.yml.

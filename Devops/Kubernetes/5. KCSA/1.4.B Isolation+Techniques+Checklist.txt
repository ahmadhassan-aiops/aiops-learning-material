Kubernetes Isolation Techniques Checklist



1. Namespace Isolation

Create separate namespaces for different environments (e.g., Development, Testing, Production).

Apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit access based on namespace.

Regularly review and manage access permissions for each namespace.



 2. Network Policies

Define and implement network policies for each namespace to control pod communication.

Test network policies to ensure they correctly restrict access as intended.

Update network policies in response to changes in application architecture or security requirements.



  3. Pod Security Policies (PSP)

Enable Pod Security Policies on the cluster.

Define and enforce policies that limit the use of privileged containers.

Ensure all deployed pods meet the PSP requirements before allowing them on the cluster.



  4. Resource Quotas and Limits

Set resource quotas for each namespace to prevent overconsumption of shared resources.

Define CPU and memory limits for each pod to ensure predictable performance.

Monitor resource usage and adjust quotas and limits as necessary.



  5. Node Isolation and Pod Affinity

Apply taints to nodes to control which pods can schedule on them.

Define pod affinity and anti-affinity rules to optimize and secure workload placement.

Regularly review node and pod configurations to align with security and performance needs.

  6. Service Mesh Implementation

Choose and implement a service mesh (e.g., Istio) to manage service-to-service communications securely.

Configure mutual TLS (mTLS) through the service mesh to secure data in transit.

Set up detailed logging and monitoring via the service mesh to detect anomalies in communication patterns.

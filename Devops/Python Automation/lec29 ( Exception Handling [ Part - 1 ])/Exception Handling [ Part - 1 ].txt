Types of error:-
1. Syntax Error
2. Logic Error 
3. Runtime error Or Exception handling 

1. Syntax Error :-

You cant handle 


2. Logic Error 
a=100
b=20

if a>b:
    print("a is big")
else:
    print("b is  big")


#a=100
b=100

if a>b:

elif a==b:
    print(" Both a and b is same")

3. Exception handling :-

An Exception is error that happens during the execution of the program. Python generateds exception than could be handled. You an define your own error 

its also called runtime error.


a. NameError:-

There are no error :-
x="ABD"
print("My value is ", x)

O/p:
My value is  ABD


Error :-
x="ABD"
print("My value is ", x)
print("My value is ", y)

O/p:-NameError: name 'y' is not defined


try:
	you can paste here your program
except:
	you can print your own error 

Error handling or exception handling 
try:
    x = "ABD"
    print("My value is ", x)
    print("My value is ", y)
except:
    print("Something having issue")

O/p:

My value is  ABD
Something having issue





try:
    #x = "ABD"
    y="Ali"
    print("My value is ", x)
    print("My value is ", y)
except Exception as e:
    print("Something having issue",e)

O/p:-
Something having issue name 'x' is not defined



2. Index Error :-
We are checking Without Error :-
mylist=[2,7,8,9]
print(mylist)

o/p:[2, 7, 8, 9]



We are checking With Error :-
mylist=[2,7,8,9]
print(mylist[4])

O/p:
IndexError: list index out of range


With Execption handle:-
try:
    mylist=[2,7,8,9]
    print(mylist[4])
except Exception as e:
    print("Something issue : ",e)

O/p:-
Something issue :  list index out of range




3. Import Error:-



You can handle via execption handle:-
import osss

O/p:-ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'osss'


try:
    import oss
    os.system('dir')
except Exception as e:
    print('Something issue :' ,e)
O/p:-
Something issue : No module named 'oss'

pattern="python[2]"
print(re.findall(pattern,myword))





import re
myword="Abdeali Dodiya from bangalore , We are learning Python and in this course we will learn two version such python2 and python3, We will learn Python selenium in this course"
pattern="python[234]"
print(re.findall(pattern,myword))





import re
myword="Abdeali Dodiya from bangalore , We are learning python and in this course we will learn two version such python2 and python3, We will learn Python selenium in this course"
pattern="python[' '23]"
print(re.findall(pattern,myword))





import re
myword="Abdeali Dodiya from bangalore , We are learning python and in this course we will learn two version such python2 and python3, We will learn Python selenium in this course"

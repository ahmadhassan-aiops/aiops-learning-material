just need to go to vagrant file and using vim we have to uncomment the public network. This way we will be able to connect our host machine network with 
the vagrant.

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  config.vm.network "public_network"


------------------------------

vagrant up
vagrant ssh


now check the ip using ifconfig
use that ip to ping on command promp it will work!
----------------------------------

We will use puTTy to provide ip of vagrant and access it by providing username and password as 'vagrant'
Now if we make dir and files in vagrant from bash it will be visible in puTTY based vagrant as well!

---------------------------------------------------

Now we can exit vagrant from puTTy and bash and run destroy vagrant ad again go to vagrantfile and change

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  config.vm.network "public_network" , ip: "192.168.0.105" , bridge: "Intel(R) Wi-Fi 6 AX201 160MHz"


vagrant up
vagrant ssh
ifconfig

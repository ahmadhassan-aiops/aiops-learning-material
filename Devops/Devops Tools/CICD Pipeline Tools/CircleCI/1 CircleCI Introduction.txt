## CircleCI: Introduction (simplified)

### What is CircleCI?

* CircleCI is a **CI/CD** (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery or Deployment) platform. ([CircleCI][1])
* Its main goal is to help software teams automate the process of building, testing, and delivering code, so that changes to the codebase are verified continuously. ([CircleCI][1])
* By automating builds, tests, and deployments, CircleCI helps teams catch problems early, deliver code faster, and reduce manual work. ([CircleCI][1])

### Why is CircleCI Useful?

1. **Faster feedback** — When developers push code, CircleCI can automatically build and test it. If something goes wrong, the problems are detected early. ([CircleCI][1])
2. **Consistent builds and tests** — Because tests and builds are automated and run in predictable environments, results are more reliable and reproducible. ([CircleCI][1])
3. **Automation of repetitive tasks** — Tasks like running test suites, building Docker images, linting code, or deploying to servers can all be automated, reducing manual effort and human error. ([CircleCI][2])
4. **Integration with version control** — CircleCI works well with services like GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab. Whenever code is committed or merged, it can trigger build/test pipelines automatically. ([CircleCI][3])
5. **Flexibility** — CircleCI supports different environments (Docker containers, Linux or macOS virtual machines, Windows, ARM, GPU, etc.), so you can set up pipelines that match your project’s requirements. ([CircleCI][1])

### Key Concepts

| Term                           | What It Means (in simple terms)                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pipeline**                   | A pipeline is a series of automated steps that run when code changes are pushed. Think of it like a delivery line: build → test → deploy.                                                |
| **Job**                        | A *job* is a unit of work in a pipeline — for example, “build the code”, “run tests”, or “deploy to staging.” Jobs run inside an environment (like a Docker container).                  |
| **Workflow**                   | A *workflow* is a way to organize and orchestrate multiple jobs. You can run jobs in sequence, in parallel, or have conditional steps (e.g. “only deploy if tests pass”).                |
| **Config file (`config.yml`)** | This is a YAML configuration file (`.circleci/config.yml`) in your repository that tells CircleCI *what to do* — how to build, test, and deploy your code. ([CircleCI][4])               |
| **Execution environment**      | This defines *where* the jobs are run — for example, inside a Docker container, a Linux VM, macOS VM, etc. It affects what tools and dependencies are available. ([CircleCI][5])         |
| **Orbs**                       | Orbs are reusable CircleCI configuration packages. Think of them as “plugins” or shared snippets of YAML that simplify common CI/CD tasks, integrations, or deployments. ([CircleCI][6]) |

### CircleCI Cloud vs Self-Hosted

* **CircleCI Cloud** is a hosted version that runs CircleCI infrastructure for you. You don’t have to manage CI servers yourself — CircleCI handles the machines and scaling. ([CircleCI][1])
* **Self-hosted / Server versions** of CircleCI let you run your CI/CD pipelines on your own infrastructure (for example, inside your company’s private network). This gives more control, but also means you manage the servers yourself. ([CircleCI][1])

### How CircleCI Fits into CI/CD

* **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Code changes from multiple developers are merged into a shared main branch frequently. CircleCI runs automated builds and tests on every change to help catch errors early. ([CircleCI][1])
* **Continuous Delivery or Deployment (CD)**: After code passes tests, CircleCI can automatically or manually deploy the code to staging or production environments. This ensures that software is always ready for release. ([CircleCI][7])

### A Simple CircleCI Pipeline Example

Here’s a very basic example of a CircleCI config file that just prints “Hello World” — CircleCI will run the job automatically using a Docker container:

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: alpine:3.15
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Hello job
          command: |
            echo "Hello World!"
```

What happens in this example:

* `version: 2.1` tells CircleCI which config version you’re using. ([CircleCI][4])
* A *job* named `build` is defined. ([CircleCI][4])
* The `docker` section means: run this job inside an *Alpine Linux Docker image version 3.15*. ([CircleCI][4])
* Under `steps`, there’s a `run` command which prints “Hello World!” to the log. ([CircleCI][4])

Even this simple pipeline shows how CircleCI can run things automatically, without you having to manually build or test your code on your local machine or server.

### Summary

* CircleCI is a tool that automates the *build → test → deploy* workflow for software projects.
* Its automation helps developers deliver code more reliably and quickly, by catching errors early and reducing manual work.
* You control how CircleCI works using a `.circleci/config.yml` file, which defines jobs and steps.
* CircleCI can run your tasks in Docker containers, virtual machines, or other environments, making it versatile across different projects.
* For beginners, CircleCI is a helpful way to adopt CI/CD practices without needing to build your own infrastructure from scratch.

First connect your teamcity with github using github authApp. 


Since TeamCity is running on a **CentOS VM inside VirtualBox (NAT mode, port 8111 forwarded)**, GitHub integration only works if the VM can 
resolve external domains. By default, `/etc/resolv.conf` pointed to the host’s DNS (`10.0.2.2`) which failed, so we fixed it by forcing public DNS servers. 
Using **`nmcli`**, we set Google (8.8.8.8) and Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) as resolvers and disabled auto-DNS from DHCP:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify enp0s3 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1"
sudo nmcli connection modify enp0s3 ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
sudo nmcli connection down enp0s3 && sudo nmcli connection up enp0s3
```

Now TeamCity can reach `github.com`, allowing the **OAuth app callback (http\://<host-ip>:8111/oauth/...)** to complete, so your VM’s TeamCity server 
successfully connects to GitHub for project/repo integration.

You forked the **SimpleMavenSample** code into your own GitHub account by cloning the original repo, removing its remote, and pushing it to a new repo 
under your username. The process looked like this:

```bash
# go to your working directory
cd /e/Alnafi/Devops/"Devops Tools"/"CICD Pipeline Tools"/"Team City"

# clone the original repo
git clone https://github.com/mkjetbrains/SimpleMavenSample.git
cd SimpleMavenSample

# remove old remote
git remote remove origin

# add your own GitHub repo as remote (created beforehand)
git remote add origin https://github.com/786AHMADHASSAN/SimpleMavenSample.git

# push your code to your repo
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

This way, you now have the **same codebase** hosted under **your own GitHub account** instead of the original author’s.

i just used this repo which was public so no need to have a repo in your account!!

After providing just proceed and build the image!

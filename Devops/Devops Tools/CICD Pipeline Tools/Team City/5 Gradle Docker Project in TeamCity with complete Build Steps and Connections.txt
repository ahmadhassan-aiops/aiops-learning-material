Repo is public so Just proceed but we will configure built manually. 

===============================================



1st build: From configuration select gradle and name the step and gradle task and save

2nd build: Now again open config and now select docker and name it. Also select dockerfiel as "path to file"
"ahmadhassan380/demo-app" --- This is the dockerhub repo that I have built in "private mode". It will be written in teamcity as iamgename:tag as
"ahmadhassan380/demo-app:v1". It is also given build number from side icon. 2nd tag also given as "ahmadhassan380/demo-app:latest"
ahmadhassan380/demo-app%build.number%
ahmadhassan380/demo-app:latest
Now save it!


3rd build: again choose docker but now select push and name step anem as iamge push (optional) and in image tag use exact same tag
ahmadhassan380/demo-app%build.number%
ahmadhassan380/demo-app:latest


#Now we just click the app "java-app" and select more options where we will select connections. Select useranem and password (old one) for docker repo 
and test connection.

Now again go back to app and add 1 feature froma dd feature tab. Select only docker support and you can delete perf monitor if you want!


#you can aslo go to agent and from their see the compatibility of config for our project. It must be compatible for that!

Now we can run!


============================================================

gradle app was not able to create due to java incompatibility as dockerfile of this pulic repo was old!


But workflow remains same

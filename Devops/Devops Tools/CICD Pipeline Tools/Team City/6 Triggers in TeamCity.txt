### 🚀 What are Triggers?

In TeamCity, **triggers** are rules that tell the build configuration **when to start a new build automatically**.
Instead of manually clicking “Run”, you let TeamCity watch for changes/events.

### 🔑 Common Trigger Types

1. **VCS Trigger**

   * Starts a build when there’s a new commit in your version control (Git, GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.).
   * Example: every `git push` triggers a build.

2. **Schedule Trigger**

   * Runs builds on a schedule (like cron jobs).
   * Example: run nightly at 2 AM.

3. **Finish Build Trigger**

   * Starts a build when another build finishes.
   * Example: run integration tests after the “Build” configuration finishes.

4. **Branch Filter in Triggers**

   * You can limit triggers to certain branches.
   * Example: only trigger builds on `main` or `develop`, not feature branches.

5. **Retry Build Trigger**

   * Can re-run a build if it fails, based on rules.

### ⚙️ How to Add a Trigger

1. Open your **Build Configuration** in TeamCity.
2. Go to **Triggers** tab.
3. Click **Add new trigger** → choose trigger type.
4. Configure settings (branch filter, quiet period, schedule time, etc.).
5. Save.

### 🧑‍💻 Example Scenarios

* **CI/CD flow:**

  * VCS Trigger → Build starts automatically on commit.
  * Finish Build Trigger → Deploy runs after build passes.

* **Nightly regression tests:**

  * Schedule Trigger → Run tests every night at 2 AM.

* **Multi-step pipeline:**

  * Build job → triggers Unit tests job → triggers Deploy job.

# ðŸ”¹ Mapping **TeamCity** with **Jenkins** â€“ Final Lecture

### 1. **Core Concept**

* **Jenkins** â†’ Open-source automation server, community-driven, highly extensible with plugins.
* **TeamCity** â†’ JetBrainsâ€™ commercial CI/CD tool, comes with many features out-of-the-box, polished UI, and enterprise focus.

---

### 2. **Installation & Setup**

* **Jenkins** â†’ Requires manual setup (plugins, jobs, agents). Can be lightweight but needs tuning.
* **TeamCity** â†’ Ships with built-in build runners (Gradle, Maven, Docker, etc.), easier out-of-the-box experience.

---

### 3. **Build Agents**

* **Jenkins** â†’ Agents (slaves) are configured manually (SSH, JNLP, Docker, Kubernetes).
* **TeamCity** â†’ Build Agents are a first-class concept, auto-register with server, plugins preloaded (Docker, Maven, Gradle).

---

### 4. **Configuration Style**

* **Jenkins** â†’ Traditionally GUI-driven jobs (Freestyle), modern approach is **Jenkinsfile** (Pipeline-as-Code, Groovy).
* **TeamCity** â†’ GUI-first, but supports **Kotlin DSL** for pipelines (Infrastructure-as-Code approach).

---

### 5. **Plugin Ecosystem**

* **Jenkins** â†’ 1,800+ community plugins, very flexible, but can cause instability if mismatched.
* **TeamCity** â†’ Curated JetBrains plugins, stable and integrated, but fewer options vs Jenkins.

---

### 6. **Scalability**

* **Jenkins** â†’ Scales with multiple controllers & agents, but needs manual tuning.
* **TeamCity** â†’ Scales easily with distributed build agents, built-in cloud integration (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes).

---

### 7. **User Interface & Usability**

* **Jenkins** â†’ Basic UI, not very intuitive, but very customizable.
* **TeamCity** â†’ Polished, modern UI with built-in test history, build chains, and code coverage reports.

---

### 8. **Security**

* **Jenkins** â†’ Requires hardening (matrix auth, plugins, secrets mgmt).
* **TeamCity** â†’ Secure defaults, integrates with enterprise SSO, RBAC, LDAP out-of-the-box.

---

### 9. **Learning Curve**

* **Jenkins** â†’ Steeper, especially with Groovy pipelines & plugin management.
* **TeamCity** â†’ Easier for beginners (intuitive UI + ready-to-use build runners).

---

### 10. **Licensing**

* **Jenkins** â†’ 100% Free & Open Source.
* **TeamCity** â†’ Free for small teams (100 build configurations, 3 agents), **commercial license** needed for scaling.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **Summary Mapping**

* If you want **free, flexible, and community-driven** â†’ choose **Jenkins**.
* If you want **enterprise-ready, stable, easy setup, with official support** â†’ choose **TeamCity**.

---

Thatâ€™s the **Final Lecture**: Jenkins = flexibility + plugins, TeamCity = polish + productivity.
Both can achieve the same CI/CD goals â€” the choice depends on **budget, team size, and control vs convenience**.

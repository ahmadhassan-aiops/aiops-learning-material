Now we will add the demo.html file in templates dir as well and rename it to trainer_form.html. It will be a replacement of trainer_details page.

When earlier we were getting home page of alnafi there were so many tabs present so we we redirect one of them to trainer details. We will select 
trainer tsheet tab. To do that we have to change index.html page again accordingly.

128	<li><a href="{{url_for('index')}}"><b>Home</b></a></li>
129	<li><a href="{{url_for('trainer_create')}}">Alnafi Tsheet</a></li>

This is called as linking!


139     <li><a href="{{url_for('trainer_data')}}">Trainer Report</a> </li>

(Now when we go to report section of home page and click trainer reports then trainer data will appear)


200   	<h1 style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:25px;"><b>Trainer details</b></h1> 
201    	<form id="reused_form" method="post" action="{{ url_for('trainer_create') }}" >

We also had to make changes in app.py file. In the trainer_create function we change the output page to trainer_form.html
One more change I made is that I had to remove the footer code from index.html file from lines 240 to 245!




Now we just make changes in demo names to appropraite names in trainer_form.html file:



<p>
    <label for="fname">First Name</label>
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" required class="form-control" placeholder="Enter the first name">
</p>

<p>
    <label for="lname">Last Name</label>
    <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" required class="form-control" placeholder="Enter the last name">
</p>

<p>
    <label for="design">Designation Name</label>
    <input type="text" id="design" name="design" required class="form-control" placeholder="Enter the designation name">
</p>

<p>
    <label for="course">Course Name</label>
    <input type="text" id="course" name="course" required class="form-control" placeholder="Enter the course name">
</p>


Now we can add the details from trainer_form template page and the data will be enter and will eventually refleted in trainer_data page!


------------------------------------------------

Now similarly we can make trainer_data looks better as well. For that we can copy the demo again and rename it to trainer_reports for displaying 
trainer_details in a better way.

We just copied our desplay_trainer code in the trainer_report.html file in the end and change the app.py trainer_data function return statement to
trainer_report.html as well. In this way our trainer details page become better as well!
